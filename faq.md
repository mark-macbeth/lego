Below is some QnA captured from previous Reddit comments, as well as some thoughts around my design philosophy.

**Q:** What are your design influences?<br>
**A:** Obviously, I'm a huge fan of the classic LEGO space era which I collected between 1979 thru 1990(ish), and none
of my ships would be possible without the amazing 2022 [Galaxy Explorer](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/galaxy-explorer-10497).
Other influences include present-day space, the Expanse, For all Mankind, and any other sci-fi that depicts
spaceships in a semi-realistic way.

**Q:** Is there a story behind the various MOC scenes?<br>
**A:** Short answer is "ish".  The slightly longer answer is "not really".  I try to preserve some models from scene to
scene to indicate a linear progression in time.  There are occasions where I've felt the jump between scenes is too
abrupt and will retcon in another scene for better continuity.  For example, several intermediate scenes were added
between [07](renders/07-cargo-xfer.md) and [08](renders/08-extender-docking.md) to smooth out the changes in the Space
Station modules, and the cargo arriving before the Extender shows up.

> TODO: nothing is shared across [13](renders/13-extender-ignition.md) and [14](renders/14-landing-pad-2.md), and this
would be a nice area of improvement were it not for the [28192](28192.md) rework required.  ðŸ˜­

**Q:** Do you re-render old scenes?<br>
**A:** It's unlikely I'd re-render an old scene because I like to see how I've progressed over time.  Additionally, the
problems with [28192](28192.md) mean a lot of rework fixing older scenes to clean them up.  I would rather spend my time
building new things going forward.

**Q:** Why do you host in GitHub?<br>
**A:**
1. It's free.
2. Eventually I want to put a Create Commons-style license on these images, and GitHub will remain an easy way to
distribute them after.
3. I've been a Software Engineer for 25+ years, and the tools are familiar to me.  I also like the protection of a
source control system; these MOCs take a _long_ time to build and render, and I want to protect them.
