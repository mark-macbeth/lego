# LEGO
Welcome to my LEGO page that showcases all of my MOCs and scenes using them.  My name is Mark, and I'm a connoisseur of
digitally-built space station-assembly art (yup, kinda niche; I get that a lot).  If you're a CDBSSAA like me then read
on!  Also, be sure to check out Reddit's [r/DigitalLego](https://www.reddit.com/r/DigitalLego/) and
[r/LegoSpace](https://www.reddit.com/r/LegoSpace/) subs where I tend to post my creations.

Enjoy, and build on!
